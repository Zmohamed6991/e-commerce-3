# Project Title: Sole Select

**Description**: Contributed and collaborated with project managers and developers on an e-commerce project called Sole Select - a sneaker trading website.

**Backend**: Go, Gin
**Database**: PostgreSQL, GORM
**Backend Deployed on**: Render

# Tools & Project Management:
**Version Control**: GitHub
**Project Management**:
 - Jira: We used Jira to implement an agile methodology to assign and manage tasks with the product manager and other developers. We used Jira to plan a 4-week sprint to complete the e-commerce project and updated Jira daily after stand-ups.
 - Slack: We used Slack as a communication platform, by communicating in huddles and channels to share findings, progress and ideas.

**Key features**:
 -  User authentication using JWT-based authentication for buyer and seller.
 -  Users can place orders, view order history, update their cart and delete a product
 -  CRUD APIs.

# My role and contribution:
**Sprint 1**:
At the start of the project, my team and I set up our development environments, including connecting to the PostgreSQL database. My main responsibility was to develop the backend functionality for the shopping cart feature using GORM for communication with the PostgreSQL database and Gin to efficiently handle HTTP requests and routes. 
In the first sprint, we focused on add to cart method, this was done in collaboration with a colleague. We utilised our boot camp training and external documentation to implement this feature.
During the Sprint 1 retrospective, our team discussed areas for improvement, identified issues like unclear project direction, and proposed solutions for a more structured workflow.

**Sprint 2**:
Having completed the "add-to-cart" method, I was assigned to work on the "edit cart" method, which allows users to modify product quantities in their shopping cart. I submitted a pull request for the feature, which was reviewed and successfully merged by the project manager.
In the sprint retrospective, our team shared the challenges we encountered, such as handling dynamic product quantities, and how each member resolved their respective blockers. I also contributed updates in Jira and planned for upcoming tasks.

**Sprint 3**:
For Sprint 3, I was responsible for developing the "view order history" functionality, enabling users to view their past orders. This involved retrieving data from the database and displaying it in the backend, which presented a new learning opportunity for me in data retrieval and from Postgres database interaction.
During the retrospective, I raised blockers related to complex queries and sought guidance from the project manager, who provided valuable input on database calls. The sprint ended with most team members submitting pull requests that were reviewed and merged.

**Sprint 4**:
The final sprint focused on wrapping up outstanding tasks. I was tasked with deploying the backend project and database on Render (link to deployment: https://e-commerce-3-5xee.onrender.com). 
We also conducted API testing using Postman to ensure the proper functionality of our endpoints.

 
# Challenges and solutions:
**Challenge 1**:
In the initial stages, the internship's structure was unclear, and this confusion affected our workflow. To resolve this, I worked closely with the product manager, who reassigned tasks and provided clearer directions for the project. Regular communication helped streamline the development process.

**Challenge 2**:
As a beginner fresh from a three-month boot camp, the fast-paced environment of completing a project in just four weeks felt overwhelming. I had to quickly get up to speed with using PostgreSQL and GORM for database interactions. To overcome this, I sought 1-on-1 guidance from the project manager, who provided mentorship and support in debugging errors and resolving technical challenges.
